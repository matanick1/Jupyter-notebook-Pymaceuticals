## README for "Pymaceuticals Inc." Jupyter Notebook

### Description:
This Jupyter notebook presents an analysis of the effects of various drugs on tumor volumes in mice. The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of these drugs in reducing tumor sizes and understand the relationships between various factors.

### Highlights:
- **Capomulin and Ramicane Effectiveness**: These two drugs showed a significant reduction in tumor volumes after treatment compared to other drugs.
- **Relationship with Mice Size**: There's a noted increase in tumor volume as the size of the mice increases.
- **Timepoint Analysis**: Post-treatment observations indicate a decrease in tumor volume as time progresses.

### Content Sections:
1. **Summary Statistics**: Provides statistical insights into the dataset.
2. **Bar and Pie Charts**: Visual representation of the data distribution and categorical insights.
3. **Quartiles, Outliers, and Boxplots**: Analyzes the spread of the tumor volume data and identifies potential outliers.
